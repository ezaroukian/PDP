  <h2>Example 3</h2>
<p>
Rules can also contain variables.
</p>
<p>
   We will use the variable "P1" or "P2" to range over the people John, Mary, and Peter.
</p>
<p>
 We will use the variable "B1" or "B2" to range over the books War and Peace, Middlemarch, and Moby-Dick.
</p>
<p>
  Here the rule is "if (the person P1 reads the book B1) then (the person P1 has as name Mary).", and we can see that
  the only arrow connects Mary to Moby-Dick, so we should respond "Yes" (i.e. P1 can only be Mary and B1 can only be Moby-Dick, 
  so P1 has the name Mary).
