    Here the rule is unchanged, but the diagram is no longer consistent with it.
  </p>
<p>
It's still true that when P1 = Mary and B1 = Moby-Dick, P1 has the name Mary.

</p>
<p>
However, when P1 = John and B1 = War and Peace, P1 has the name John, not Mary. The diagram, therefore, is not consistent with the rule.
